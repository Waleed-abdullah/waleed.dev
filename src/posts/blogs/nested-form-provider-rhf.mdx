# Using multiple forms through a single form provider (React Hook Form)
<Subheading text="June 09, 2025" /> 


Ever had two form elements that you were controlling through useForm, but you want to access the form state for that form throughout the entire page/route and you don't wanna pass props around every component, maybe there is a toast that you want to show based on a certain form state.

Out of the box, React Hook Form provides us a way to access the form state throughout the entire page/route, which is `FormProvider`, and `useFormContext`.


I will not be describing how to use `<FormProvider/>` and `useFormContext` in this post, You can read more about them in the [official documentation](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useformcontext). Rhf itself discourages from using `FormProvider` in a nested way.


The main issue arises when you have multiple forms within a layout/page and you want to access the form state for all those forms throughout the entire layout/page.

`<FormProvider/>` internally uses React's context api to provide the form.

So what we can do is create our own form provider through the context api.


```tsx 
'use client';

import { createContext, type ReactNode, useContext, useMemo } from 'react';
import { useForm, type UseFormReturn } from 'react-hook-form';


// these are just sample types you can use your preferred schema validation library to define schemas and infer types
type SearchSchemaType = { 
  search?: string;
};

type InputSchemaType = {
  input?: string;
};

interface IFormsContext {
  searchFormHook: UseFormReturn<SearchSchemaType>;
  inputFormHook: UseFormReturn<InputSchemaType>;
}

const FormsContext = createContext<IFormsContext | null>(null);

export const FormsProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  const searchFormHook = useForm<SearchSchemaType>();
  const inputFormHook = useForm<InputSchemaType>();

  const value = useMemo(
    () => ({ searchFormHook, inputFormHook }),
    [searchFormHook, inputFormHook]
  );

  return (
    <FormsContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</FormsContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useFormsContext = () => {
  const context = useContext(FormsContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useFormsContext must be used within a FormsProvider');
  }
  return context;
};

```

The above can be generalized according to your use-case.

## Why Rhf \<FormProvider/> doesn't work

React Hook Form's `FormProvider` doesn't work well in a nested way because of how it's implemented internally.

You can view the complete source code [here](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/blob/master/src/useFormContext.tsx).

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import type { FieldValues, FormProviderProps, UseFormReturn } from './types';

const HookFormContext = React.createContext<UseFormReturn | null>(null);
HookFormContext.displayName = 'HookFormContext';

export const FormProvider = <
  TFieldValues extends FieldValues,
  TContext = any,
  TTransformedValues = TFieldValues,
>(
  props: FormProviderProps<TFieldValues, TContext, TTransformedValues>,
) => {
  const { children, ...data } = props;
  return (
    <HookFormContext.Provider value={data as unknown as UseFormReturn}>
      {children}
    </HookFormContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

 The `FormProvider` uses a single React context that can only hold one form's state at a time. When you nest `FormProvider`s, each provider overwrites the previous context value because they're using the same context.

 Each nested `FormProvider` completely replaces the parent's form state in the context. This means that when you try to access form state using `useFormContext` in a nested component, you'll only get access to the closest parent's form state, losing access to any outer form states.
